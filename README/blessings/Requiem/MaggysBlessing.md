## Effect
When Isaac drops to the lowest possible HP value, this blessing is granted. Every 3 room clears, grants Isaac 1 hit worth of HP copied from his current health types chosen at random.

Effect takes place only if Isaac's effective HP is less than 1/3rd of his max possible HP.

Non-vanilla characters need to drop to exactly 2 effective HP to obtain this effect. Each half red / soul / black heart counts as 1 effective HP, bone / eternal / rotten hearts count as 1 effective hp, coin heart counts as 2 effective HP.
